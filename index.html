  <h1>MSc in Computer Science</h1>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
  <p>A minimum of an upper second-class UK Bachelor's degree in a subject other than computer science or information technology, or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard is required. Evidence should be included within the application to demonstrate suitable mathematical skills (to at least Mathematics A level), analytical skills and prior experience of basic computer programming. </p>

  <div class="w3-container w3-teal">
  <h2>About this degree</h2></div>
  <p>You will learn fundamental aspects of how computers work by taking modules in computer architecture, operating systems, compilers, data structures and algorithms. You will also gain practical knowledge in areas such as human-computer interaction, App design, databases and software engineering. You will develop programming skills in modern languages, such as object-oriented Java for Android development.

Team working, project planning and communication skills are developed by working in small groups developing software for real industrial and research clients. <br></br>Optional modules allow specialisation in subjects such as functional programming, computer music, entrepreneurship and artificial intelligence.

Students undertake modules to the value of 180 credits.

<br></br>The programme consists of six core modules, including a research project (135 credits), up to three optional modules (maximum 45 credits) and up to two elective modules (30 credits).</p>
